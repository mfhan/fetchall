# fetchall

A Delivery App using REACT

This is a group project (4 students) created over two weeks of REACT.js studies. I then made some personal tweaks to the front-end for more impactful language and consistent color scheme. 

The app allows: 
-- New user registration under two categories: Customer and Fetcher
-- New order creation (for customers)
-- Order Retrieval capability (for fetchers)
-- Automatic Order creation notification by email 
-- Order pick-up Modal 
-- Automatic Order pick-up notification by email 
-- Removal of delivered orders from Orders screen 
-- Log-in, log-out
