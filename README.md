# fetchall

A Delivery App using REACT<br>
Available on: https://mf-fetch.herokuapp.com
<br>

This is a group project (4 students) created over two weeks of REACT.js studies. I then made some personal tweaks to the front-end for more impactful language and consistent color scheme. <br>

The app allows:  <br>
-- New user registration under two categories: Customer and Fetcher <br>
-- New order creation (for customers) <br>
-- Order Retrieval capability (for fetchers) <br>
-- Automatic Order creation notification by email  <br>
-- Order pick-up Modal  <br>
-- Automatic Order pick-up notification by email  <br>
-- Removal of delivered orders from Orders screen  <br>
-- Log-in, log-out  <br>
